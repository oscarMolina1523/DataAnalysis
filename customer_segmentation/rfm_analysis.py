# What is RFM?

# R (Recency): How recent a customer's last purchase was.
# ðŸ‘‰ The lower the value, the more "active" the customer is.

# F (Frequency): How many times a customer purchased (number of different invoices).
# ðŸ‘‰ A customer who purchases frequently has a higher value.

# M (Monetary): How much the customer spent in total.
# ðŸ‘‰ Customers who spend more have a higher value.
